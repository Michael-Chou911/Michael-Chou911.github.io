title: "PIC Data Analysis Report"
excerpt: "This study was conducted based on the Paediatric Intensive Care (PIC) Database, focusing on the analysis of clinical characteristics of paediatric Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. It aimed to explore age distribution patterns and the correlation between laboratory indicators and clinical outcomes, thereby providing data support for the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric critical illnesses. A predictive model was constructed based on 6 laboratory indicators to predict patient outcomes. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model were 0.944, 0.014, and 0.998, respectively. The high specificity of the model indicated its excellent accuracy in predicting survival outcomes; however, the low sensitivity suggested that the model had a relatively low accuracy in predicting mortality outcomes. Notably, the average impact of lab-5257-min, the most important predictive factor, exceeded 0.4, which was substantially higher than that of lab-5225-range, the second most important predictive factor.<br/><img src='/images/figure4.png'>"
