I am a first-year PhD student at the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, supervised by Professor Qiao Xue. My previous research experience focused on the semi-rational engineering of enzymes, the mining and design of bioactive peptides in yeast. Currently, my research interests lie in the biosynthesis of plant natural products and the engineering of plant P450 enzymes.

Research Interests
======
1. My research focuses on deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of plant natural products. For well-recognized plant natural products with unclear biosynthetic routes, I aim to identify key biosynthetic enzymes using multi-omics technologies, thereby elucidating their complete biosynthetic pathways. Additionally, the mined key enzymes will be employed as core biological parts to achieve the combinatorial biomanufacturing of target molecules.
2. Another research focus of mine is the engineering of plant cytochrome P450 enzymes. As core biocatalysts in the biosynthesis of plant natural products, cytochrome P450 enzymes play pivotal roles in catalyzing diverse oxidative reactions, which are critical for generating the structural diversity and biological activities of natural products. However, natural plant P450 enzymes often suffer from limitations such as low catalytic efficiency, poor substrate specificity, and instability in heterologous expression systems—factors that hinder their application in synthetic biology and industrial biomanufacturing. To address these challenges, I aim to modify plant P450 enzymes through semi-rational engineering and directed evolution strategies, combining computational design, site-directed mutagenesis, and high-throughput screening methods. The goal is to tailor their catalytic properties, including enhancing catalytic activity, expanding substrate scope, and improving stability, thereby developing high-performance P450 biocatalysts. These engineered enzymes will serve as key components for constructing efficient biosynthetic pathways, facilitating the green and sustainable production of valuable plant natural products and their derivatives.
